            "Most of us had an anatomy or wellness class at some point in school. Yet,\u00a0as time passes, you might have forgotten some of those lessons.\u00a0Have you ever\u00a0asked yourself questions like: What are female hormones? What is their function? What hormones do I have in my body?\u00a0If so, this post is for you.\u00a0 Below, we talk through female hormone basics and what you need to know.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "Before we go on, there is no shame in not knowing the complexities of hormones or your body\u2019s function. Instead, we\u2019re here to help educate you so you can make informed decisions about your healthcare.\u00a0Keep reading to learn about hormones, hormonal changes, and when something might be wrong.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "Hormones are the body\u2019s chemical messengers. These messengers tell your body what, how,\u00a0and when to function.\u00a0Hormones\u00a0are produced by the endocrine system and travel throughout the body to tissue\u00a0and organs\u00a0in the bloodstream.\u00a0They can affect a range of body functions, including growth, sexual function, mood, metabolism, and reproduction.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "The female body has three main hormones. These are estrogen, progesterone,\u00a0and testosterone. The basic female hormones help the body function properly. They also\u00a0regulate\u00a0functions\u00a0like menstruation, menopause, reproduction, and more.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "Your hormones naturally fluctuate throughout your life. A board-certified gynecologist can help you navigate these changes no matter your age or phase in life. These changes are important in growth and development and foundational to your aging. You\u2019re probably already familiar with the major changes, such as puberty, menstruation, pregnancy, and menopause.\u00a0",
            "Puberty usually begins around ages 8-14. During this time, the body stimulates estrogen and progesterone production. This results in menstruation, breast development, hair growth, anatomy changes, and oil production.\u00a0",
            "Menstruation can happen anytime during puberty, though it usually begins around age 12. A menstruation cycle is made up of three phases. Hormonal birth control methods disrupt this process by inhibiting\u00a0ovulation.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "Pregnancy is when a fertilized egg is implanted on the wall of the uterus. Remember, this happens during the luteal phase of menstruation we talked about above. In the early stages of pregnancy,\u00a0the body produces\u00a0pregnancy hormones, and progesterone levels rise. After the end of a pregnancy, hormones slowly return to normal over time. After pregnancy, some experience low estrogen levels during breastfeeding, which can suppress ovulation for a time. \u00a0",
            "Menopause is a hormonal change characterized by a lack of menstruation. Typically, the onset of perimenopause\u00a0\u2013 or\u00a0the time your body begins the transition to menopause \u2013 is around\u00a0the mid to late 40s, though some women experience it sooner.\u00a0Perimenopause includes the \u201ctypical\u201d symptoms you may know about menopause. This includes hot flashes, mood changes, vaginal dryness, trouble sleeping, and irregular periods. This phase\u00a0usually lasts a few years.\u00a0Then,\u00a0menopause\u00a0generally begins around age 51.\u00a0During menopause, estrogen and progesterone levels are produced at a lower level. This can cause age-related hormone symptoms such as vaginal dryness, low sexual desire, and bone density loss.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "While hormonal changes throughout life, sometimes hormones can become imbalanced unexpectedly. If you experience any of the following symptoms, you may have imbalanced hormones. You should talk to your gynecologist to understand your symptoms. Sometimes, symptoms and imbalance may be the sign of another condition. These can\u00a0include\u00a0PCOS,\u00a0tumors,\u00a0ovarian cancer, or obesity.\u00a0It\u2019s always best to talk to your doctor if you have any of the following symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "No two people are exactly alike.\u00a0There are three active hormones in the female body, estrogen, progesterone, and testosterone. These three main hormones may function differently for each person. But all three do work together to ensure the body works properly. Menstruation, reproduction, pregnancy, and menopause are all controlled by hormones. Each is an important aspect of female health. But\u00a0it\u2019s more than just pregnancy and periods.\u00a0Imbalances\u00a0can cause a host of symptoms or be a sign of something more worrisome. Always talk with your doctor if\u00a0you\u2019re\u00a0experiencing unexplained symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0",

            "Every college campus has safeguards in place to protect you. Find out what your school offers and use those resources for protection. For example, some colleges provide sober driver services on the weekend or escorts who will walk with you across campus at night. Also, memorize your university\u2019s emergency phone number. Hopefully, you\u2019ll never need it but will be prepared in case you do.",
            "Walking alone, especially at night, makes you particularly vulnerable. The buddy system is very important to help avoid dangerous situations. Always walk in pairs or groups, so no one is left alone. This may help decrease your odds of being targeted and ensure your safety.",
            "It\u2019s worth reiterating that when you\u2019re inside your car, dorm room, apartment, or otherwise: lock the door. Don\u2019t forget to lock up when you leave too. Leaving a door unlocked could make both you and your personal space more vulnerable.",
            "Chances are, you have several social media accounts; and while social media is great for sharing our photos, we should be mindful about what we share online\u2014especially with Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and online dating apps.",
            "Here are some basic steps to follow when it comes to online personal safety. One is to make sure your location on your smartphone is turned off. Someone may be able to use your location data against you in harmful ways. Also, avoid using location \u2018check-in\u2019 features on platforms like Foursquare and Facebook. Another rule is to limit the amount of personal information you include on your profile and in posts \u2013 never give away private information, including your phone number or address. It\u2019s also a smart idea to limit your in-app chat features to friends only. This will help keep strangers from fishing for private information. Finally, if you meet someone online, be very careful when meeting them in person. Always meet for the first time in a public place \u2013 like a coffee shop \u2013 and be sure a friend or family member is aware of your plans and who you are with.",

You\u2019ve probably asked yourself, \u201cDo I\u00a0really\u00a0need a gynecologist?\u201d While\u00a0it is an understandable question, gynecology and specialized female healthcare are vital to a woman\u2019s overall health and wellness. All women regardless of age can benefit from having a dedicated GYN. Keep reading to learn why you need one and reasons to see a gynecologist.",
            "Gynecology is\u00a0the field of medicine dedicated to\u00a0female\u00a0health, specifically the reproductive system. While related, obstetrics and gynecology \u2013 known together as OBGYN \u2013 may focus on different facets of female health. For example, gynecology focuses primarily on the health and wellness of the female reproductive system, while obstetrics focuses primarily on pregnancy.\u00a0Most female health doctors are board-certified in both obstetrics and gynecology.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "Gynecologists\u00a0have specialized training in female anatomy and organs. Usually, a gynecologist will have expertise from a women\u2019s health, gynecology,\u00a0or OBGYN fellowship, allowing them to provide sub-specialized care that a general practitioner may not be able to provide.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "Gynecologists primarily see patients for general women\u2019s care, condition diagnosis,\u00a0and ongoing female health support. While gynecologists\u00a0focus on the female reproductive system, they are also able to provide additional healthcare services and can serve as a primary care provider. The most common reasons to see a gynecologist are:\u00a0",
            "Often, abnormal menstruation, hormonal symptoms, and sexual health concerns bring patients to their GYN. However,\u00a0gynecologists\u00a0are equipped to handle a variety of female health concerns\u00a0beyond sexual and reproductive health, including obesity, diabetes, cancer care, second opinions, and more.\u00a0If you\u2019re having symptoms or experiencing problems, you should see a gynecologist.\u00a0",

Depending upon your age, you may need different testing or screenings to help detect\u00a0conditions, such as breast cancer, cervical cancer, HPV, and more. At any stage in life, a gynecologist can provide ongoing, specialized care and support for female health and wellness.\u00a0",
            "What\u2019s important is that you create a meaningful relationship with a GYN. This will only benefit your healthcare. As you age, a gynecologist must take the time to get to know you and listen to you so that you can effectively prevent and detect any changes to your health and body. You must trust your GYN so that you may call them to discuss sensitive matters and whenever you have a problem.",

            "Intermittent fasting is rapidly becoming one of the world\u2019s most popular health and wellness trends. Many celebrities sing its praises, citing its health benefits and ease of use. But they aren\u2019t the only ones. In fact, millions of people around the world now use this ancient way of eating to lose weight, improve health, and even live longer. In this guide, we\u2019ll explore all facets of intermittent fasting, including its history, advantages, options, rules, and the stages of the fasting process. Read on to learn more.",
            "Simply put, fasting means you stop eating or stop eating almost completely for a certain amount of time. Furthermore, intermittent fasting (IF) is an eating schedule, which alternates between periods of little to no food and times in which you\u2019re allowed to eat. Typically, when on an IF diet for weight loss, all calories consumed must be made up of \u2018good\u2019 foods, like vegetables or whole grains during designated hours of the day. This type of fasting can help regulate blood sugar levels and boost metabolism by burning more fat than usual. Additionally, fasting can help promote better brain function and protein-sparing weight loss, which could even help prevent cancer.",
            "Though fasting has seen a recent surge in popularity, it\u2019s been around since at least the 5th century BCE when Greek physician, Hippocrates, recommended it to patients with certain illnesses. Additionally, humans have used fasting as a form of therapy to treat diseases like obesity and diabetes as early as the 1900s. But humans aren\u2019t the only ones who benefit from this way of eating. In fact, fasting is part of the life cycle for many living organisms. Often, animals undergo periods of food deprivation to survive, including hibernation and migration.",
            "IF is an ancient practice with roots in many cultures and religions across the world. However, it continues to gain more attention as research uncovers more of its health and wellness benefits. Here are just a few of the possible advantages of IF:",
            "So, what happens inside your body as it goes through as it transitions from \u2018feeding to fasting\u2019? Here are the five stages of metabolism and fasting:",
            "Basically, these stages cumulatively trigger the body to start using stored fat for energy instead of its preferred energy source, glucose. Additionally, the increased growth hormone levels help to ensure muscle tissue is preserved during fasting.",
            "There isn\u2019t just one way to fast or even a preferred IF regiment. In fact, there are many types of IF, all with a unique style. Additionally, each style carries its own benefits \u2013 from boosting metabolism, promoting disease prevention or cellular repair, to improving psychological wellbeing. Some evidence shows eating earlier (noon to 4p) may be better for weight loss than later in the day. Typically, the longer the fast, the greater the benefit. However, fasting for prolonged periods of more than 24 hours with no food is not recommended, as it may lead to cognitive side effects like depression or anxiety due to decreased levels of serotonin production (which regulates sleep cycles).",
            "Below is a brief description of multiple IF options:",
            "Though most foods and beverages are restricted during fasting, there are a few items that are permitted. Only the following are allowed for consumption during the \u2018fasting window\u2019:",
            "In closing, IF\u2019s popularity is on the rise for a reason. Fasting is not only a simple and effective method of losing weight. It can also provide a wealth of other health benefits for the mind and body. However, it is not for everyone. Always check with your doctor first to make sure IF is right for you. Also, consider starting slowly with a 12-hour overnight fast to ease into your journey to improving your overall health and wellbeing.",

            "The goal in your 20s and 30s should be\u00a0to know\u00a0your body. The better you understand your own body and health, the easier it is to understand when something is\u00a0abnormal. Regular preventive care visits and a good relationship with your doctor is key.\u00a0Regular pelvic exams, Pap smears,\u00a0and hormone testing can help keep you on the path to good health.\u00a0\u00a0",

            "At this stage in your life, a gynecologist can help support you through continued regular exams, mammograms, Pap smears, general healthcare, yearly exams, and mental health care. Prevention should be a focus at this age. Lowering your risk of disease, like heart disease and breast cancer, is vital.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "This can mean discussing birth control after 40 or perhaps\u00a0getting pregnant at a later stage in life.\u00a0Moreover, problems\u00a0can still arise in your 40s and 50s. For example,\u00a0endometriosis\u00a0and\u00a0uterine fibroids\u00a0may not present until a woman is in her 30s and 40s or sometimes later.

Yet, preventive and annual exams are still an important piece of your healthcare.\u00a0Staying well means receiving preventive screenings for heart health, breast cancer,\u00a0cervical cancer, and bone density.\u00a0",
            "Hormonal changes at this age are common. Menopause, for example, usually begins in the 50s. Many\u00a0think\u00a0of menopause as merely hot flashes, but it is much more. The process can be different for everyone, and it\u2019s important to find ongoing care and support during this time.\u00a0Also, a gynecologist can help you maintain sexual satisfaction and desire, which may naturally decline with age-related hormonal changes.\u00a0",
            "If you\u2019re not sure you need a gynecologist at your age, we hope this article helps. It can be confusing to know when you need care and who to turn to. Fortunately, GYNs can help women at any age with a variety of healthcare needs. It\u2019s\u00a0much more than just your Pap smear and pregnancy.\u00a0\u00a0",

            "A: We believe that by eliminating the middleman, or the insurance company, we provide better care directly to you.\u00a0 The time traditionally spent on billing, coding, and data entry is returned to the patient.\u00a0 This means a more efficient office and more time for your visit.\u00a0 In addition, the insurance company will no longer be in control of what care you need, or what referrals, labs, and imaging you need.",

At HaneyGYN, we are proud to offer this game-changing treatment to the women of Nashville, TN, and the surrounding area. Read on to learn the answers to some of your most frequently asked questions about Mona Lisa Touch\u00ae.",
            "The MonaLisa Touch\u00ae is a carbon dioxide laser specifically designed to treat vaginal tissue. Similar to laser facial treatments, the procedure uses lasers to make micro-abrasions or tiny scratches in the vaginal wall, which stimulate the growth of new blood vessels and promotes healing. Furthermore, the gentle laser treatment can regenerate your vaginal tissue safely and effectively. Additionally, it provides you with a hormone-free, medication-free solution to a range of pelvic health conditions.",
            "Naturally, your estrogen levels decline as you age, especially after menopause. As this happens, your vaginal tissue can atrophy, meaning your vaginal tissue becomes thinner and dryer than when you were younger. This may also cause your vaginal tissue to become inflamed and cause itching, burning, discomfort, and even bleeding.",
            "Vaginal atrophy may also cause you to experience the following conditions, which Mona Lisa Touch can help treat and reverse",
            "During a Mona Lisa Touch treatment, gentle laser energy is delivered to the vaginal wall tissue and stimulates a healing response in the vaginal canal. A small metal wand much like an ultrasound wand is inserted into the vagina (in the same place where a tampon would be inserted) and turned in a clockwise and counterclockwise motion targeting the vaginal tissue. The laser treatment is painless, minimally invasive, and takes less than 5 minutes to perform. Some patients report mild discomfort with the laser tip insertion during the first procedure if there is vaginal dryness or atrophy. Patients experience very little downtime or side effects and the procedure is performed in the comfort of our office. Anesthesia is not necessary.",
            "Most women can return to their normal routine soon after having MonaLisa Touch treatment, although you may be asked to refrain from sexual intercourse for two or three days.",
            "The MonaLisa Touch\u00ae requires a series of three to four laser sessions. These 5-minute sessions are scheduled about six weeks apart. Additionally, some patients may require treatment touch-ups once a year.",
            "Most women are able to tolerate treatments very well. However, some may experience temporary, minor side effects such as mild vaginal bleeding, vaginal discharge, tenderness, itching, or burning.",
            "This treatment is ideal for perimenopausal and postmenopausal women, as well as women with breast cancer who experience vaginal dryness as a result of chemotherapy or hormone therapy. Additionally, younger women who have experienced stretched vaginal tissue due to childbirth may benefit from this treatment.",
            "For more info about MonaLisa Touch, as well as to help determine if the treatment is right for you, call us at 615.736.4187.",
